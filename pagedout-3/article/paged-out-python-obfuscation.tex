\section*{Deceptive Python Decompilation}

\vspace*{-0.5\baselineskip}

Software obfuscation is the science and art of modifying a program to hide certain aspects of it, for example what the program does or how it accomplishes a certain task. The goal is to slow down reverse engineering of the program to exhaust the analyst's ``budget'' whether that is time, money or interest. Some obfuscation techniques are better at thwarting automated analysis, for example by exploiting assumptions and limitations in analysis tools, while others are more aimed at making life a pain for a human reverse engineer. The latter type can be achieved for example by adding a lot of useless stuff to the program or writing code that seemingly does one thing while it actually does something else\footnote{See the \textit{Underhanded C Contest} for great examples}.

\subsection*{Python Bytecode}

\vspace*{-0.3\baselineskip}

The technique we will discuss here is a way of obfuscating Python bytecode. Before Python source code is executed\footnote{In the CPython implementation}, it is compiled into Python bytecode. The bytecode is then executed in the stack-based VM inside CPython. Sometimes programs are shipped as Python source code but it is possible to only use the .pyc files containing the compiled bytecode. For example, this is what py2exe does when building a stand-alone executable.

\subsection*{Bytecode Decompilation Tricks}

\vspace*{-0.3\baselineskip}


When trying to analyze Python bytecode, it is desirable to turn it back into regular Python code for readability. A popular tool to do this is uncompyle6 which usually works amazingly well for decompiling Python bytecode. There exist multiple ways to fool it however. One way to mess up the decompilation is to craft Python bytecode that can't be produced from valid Python code, such as abusing exceptions for flow control. This is powerful because the decompilation will likely fail since the original code isn't actually Python to start with. The downside is that you need to either write the bytecode by hand or create your own compiler.

Another way is to abuse variable names. Python bytecode retains all the variable names to enable reflection. In contrast to the Python language, the CPython VM itself has no restrictions on variable naming. This can be abused by replacing all variable names with whitespace. It will transform code from:

\begin{minted}{python}
S, j = range(256), 0
for i in range(256):
    j = (j + S[i] + key[i % keylength]) % 256
    S[i], S[j] = S[j], S[i]  # swap
\end{minted}

into bytecode which decompiles into something like this:

\begin{minted}{python}
 ,    = range(256), 0
for     in range(256):
    = (   +    [   ] +     [   %     ]) % 256
        [   ],     [  ] =     [  ],     [   ]
\end{minted}

The resulting code isn't even valid Python code. The downside with this technique is that it is very obvious that something went wrong and a slight adjustment to the decompilation process completely neutralizes it. 

Inspired by this method, we can do something more subtle. Consider the following code which almost implements RC4:

\begin{minted}{python}
def rc4(data, key):
  ...
  for i in range(256):
    ...
  OBFUSCATION = 0
  for b in data:
    i = (i + 1) % 256
    j = (j + S[i]) % 256
    ...
  ...
\end{minted}

By replacing the name of the variable ``OBFUSCATION'' with ``i = 0\textbackslash n  j'', the code will decompile into this:

\begin{minted}{python}
def rc4(data, key):
  ...
  for i in range(256):
    ...
  i = 0
  j = 0
  for b in data:
    i = (i + 1) % 256
    j = (j + S[i]) % 256
    ...
  ...
\end{minted}

The decompiled code now implements RC4 correctly and would typically not warrant any further scrutiny since it's just an implementation of a well-known algorithm. This is the key element because the decompiled code is now functionally different to the original code and its corresponding bytecode. In the initial version, the value of the variable $i$ will be $255$ when it enters the second loop but in the decompiled version it will be $0$. If this function is used as part of an unpacker, it will mean that even though the reverse engineer uses the correct key, the payload will never be succesfully decrypted. This could easily throw many reverse engineers off and make them waste a lot of time.

The key idea of this method is to create a program that decompiles to seemingly correct code to not raise suspicion and thereby throwing the analyst off while hiding the true functionality of the code.
