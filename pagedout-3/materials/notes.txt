Obfuscation:
resource exhaustion
budget: time, money, interest

python bytecode
variable names

decompiler
uncompyle6

~assumes bytecode was generated from Python code
abuse control flow with try-except

restore variable names

legal variable names
python code vs byte code

previous examples:
whitespace

types of obfuscation
hide
mislead

new example:
m != d(c(m))

PoC 1:
x = 1
EVIL = 2

s/EVIL/x /

x = 1
x  = 2

PoC 2:
x = 1
EVIL = 3

s/EVIL/x = 2\nx/

x = 1
x = 2
x = 3

PoC 3:
for x in range(10):
    ...
EVIL = 0
while x < 20:
   ...

s/EVIL/x = 0\ny/

for x in range(10):
    ...
x = 0
y = 0
while x < 20:
   ...



how to avoid:
check symbol names
ast.parse_name ???
